# spiro <img src="man/figures/logo.svg" align="right" height=140/>

The `spiro` package creates spirographs in the .svg file format. There are functions in `spiro` that transform and animate your spirographs after they have been created.

## Installation

You can install spiro from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("wjschne/spirographer")
```

## Example

Here is a basic spirograph.

```{r example}
library(spiro)
spiro(
  fixed_radius = 11, 
  cycling_radius = 4, 
  pen_radius = 9, 
  file = "example.svg") 
```
