Description: Familiar to those who have spent hours with the classic toy "Spirograph," 
             hypotrochoids and epitrochoids are shapes formed by tracing the path of 
             a pen inside a circle as it rolls around inside or outside another circle.
             With this package, you can create, modify, and animate spirograph-like 
             shapes in the svg format.
